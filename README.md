# Project Goal: Learn how to apply and compare RNN-based architectures for Bitcoin price forecasting using historical Kaggle data.
## Models Compared:
    Baseline LSTM
    Seq2Seq Encoder–Decoder
    Transformer (Encoder-only)

## Two Dataset Settings:
    final_project_v1.ipynb: univariate forecasting using the Close price
    final_project_v1-Copy1.ipynb: multivariate forecasting using OHLCV features
